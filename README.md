# Interactive-sales-analytics-dashboard-app

### This project uses the Python language to build a complete and professional Sales Analytics Data App from start to finish. 

Streamlit is used to build an interactive web application ready for your portfolio. 
The goal is to create an executive dashboard that connects to an SQLite database, 
displays KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and allows the user to dynamically filter data and export reports. 

This is a miniature "full-stack" project, covering everything from the data backend to the interactive and styled frontend. 

#### Backend: 
• Database: Create and populate an SQLite database with sample sales data.

• Performance: Implement data caching to ensure the application loads quickly, even with database access.

#### Frontend and UI (Streamlit):

• Advanced Filters: Build a robust filter panel in the sidebar for detailed analysis.

• Professional Layout: Organize the application using tabs to separate the "Graphical View" from the "Data Export".

• KPI Visualization: Create metric cards (KPIs) with markdown and HTML/CSS for a customized and professional look. Data Visualization (Plotly):

• Create a diverse set of interactive charts with Plotly Express, including: o Line Chart (Revenue Evolution) o Pie Chart (Category Mix) o Bar Chart (Regional Performance) o Scatter Plot (Quantity vs. Revenue Correlation Analysis)
